**Task Description**:
Perform comprehensive analysis of legacy Encore Loyalty system source code archive (637 MB of PHP/CakePHP code) to extract:
- Complete database schema and data relationships

- Customer review interface and data collection
- Configuration and settings structure
- Email templates and communication patterns
- Integration hook points for AI system

**Context/Background**:
User received source code archive from Brainium team containing the legacy Encore system we don't have access to. This is a goldmine of information that can answer 30+ of our 50 critical questions and directly inform our integration strategy. The archive contains:

- [ ] Integration hook points identified
- [ ] Answer 30+ questions from `/docs/plan-mockup-to-frontend/05-QUESTIONS-AND-CLARIFICATIONS.md`
- [ ] Critical insights and recommendations
- [ ] Integration architecture recommendations

**Success Criteria**:
- Database schema fully documented (all known tables)
- All API endpoints identified with formats
- Key business workflows clearly mapped
- Integration hook points identified with recommendations
- At least 30 questions answered from Q&A document

- **MySQL Analysis**: `/docs/investigation/MYSQL-DATABASE-ANALYSIS-SUMMARY.md`
- **Brainium API Validation**: `/docs/investigation/VENUES-API-VALIDATION-REPORT.md`

**Dependencies**:
- Archive location accessible
- Worker has 4-6 hours for thorough analysis
- Worker familiar with PHP/CakePHP (or can learn quickly)

**Blockers** (if any):
- None currently

**Progress Updates**:
- 2025-10-28: Prompt created, awaiting worker assignment

**Expected Impact**:
üî• **HIGH IMPACT** - This analysis will:
- Answer 30+ critical questions blocking decisions
- Define exact integration requirements
- Identify all API endpoints we need to match
- Reveal business logic we need to preserve
- Guide our backend API development
- Inform our frontend integration strategy
- Reduce risk by understanding legacy system thoroughly

**Completion Notes** (when done):
_To be filled by worker upon completion_

## üéØ DELEGATION PRINCIPLES

### When to Delegate

**Delegate To AI Threads When**:
- Task is well-defined with clear requirements
- Can be completed independently
- Success criteria are measurable
- Reference documentation exists
- Focused scope (single feature/component)

**Delegate To Human Developers When**:
- Complex architectural decisions needed
- Requires deep domain expertise
- Involves security-critical code
- Needs production deployment
- Integration with external systems

**Keep With Supervisor When**:
- Strategic planning and coordination
- Decision-making across components
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Documentation synthesis
- Progress tracking and reporting

### Delegation Best Practices

1. **Clear Scope**: Define exactly what needs to be done
2. **Complete Context**: Provide all necessary background
3. **Success Criteria**: Define what "done" looks like
4. **Resources**: Link to relevant docs, code, examples
5. **Timeline**: Set realistic deadlines
6. **Deliverables**: Specify concrete outputs
7. **Dependencies**: Identify blockers and prerequisites
8. **Follow-Up**: Check progress regularly

### Worker Selection Guide

**Cursor Chat Threads**:
- Best for: Focused implementation tasks
- Examples: Single component, API endpoint, feature
- Limitation: Limited context window

**Windsurf**:
- Best for: Alternative perspective on complex tasks
- Examples: Architecture decisions, optimization
- Strength: Different approach than Cursor

**TRAE**:
- Best for: Automated, repetitive tasks
- Examples: Code generation, migrations, bulk updates
- Strength: Speed and consistency

**Claude Code**:
- Best for: Complex reasoning and planning
- Examples: Architecture design, problem-solving
- Strength: Deep analysis and explanation

**Human Developers**:
- Best for: Production-critical work
- Examples: Security, deployment, integration
- Strength: Judgment and accountability
