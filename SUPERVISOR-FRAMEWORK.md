# AI Supervisor Framework
## Encore Loyalty AI Feedback System

**Date Created**: October 28, 2025
**Version**: 1.0
**Purpose**: Complete framework for AI supervision of the Encore Loyalty AI Feedback System development

---

## 🎯 MISSION STATEMENT

Transform Encore Loyalty with an AI-driven feedback management system that:
- Analyzes customer reviews using AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- Automatically generates personalized responses
- Provides real-time analytics and insights
- Integrates seamlessly with the legacy Encore system (no direct access needed)

---

## 📊 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### What We're Building

**Three-Part System**:

1. **Frontend** (`encore_frontend`)
   - React TypeScript application
   - Admin interface for provisioning and monitoring
   - Venue manager interface for AI configuration and feedback management
   - Analytics dashboards

2. **Backend** (`encore_backend`)
   - FastAPI application
   - AWS Bedrock integration (AI analysis)
   - AWS DynamoDB (modern data storage)
   - MySQL integration (legacy Encore data via SSH)
   - AWS SES (email communication)

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Brainium Venues API (external venue management)
   - Legacy Encore system (read-only access via MySQL)
   - AWS services (Bedrock, DynamoDB, SES, S3)

### Current State

**✅ COMPLETED**:
- Mockup: 100% functional (29 components, 8,000+ lines, fully tested)
- Planning: Comprehensive documentation for all teams
- Backend Infrastructure: FastAPI + AWS services configured
- Database Analysis: MySQL production data analyzed (1.58 GB, 61K reviews)
- Brainium API: Validated (with noted issues)

**🟡 IN PROGRESS**:
- Conversion planning (mockup → production frontend)
- Backend API endpoint specification (40+ endpoints needed)
- Brainium API fixes (provisioning fields returning null)

**🔴 PENDING**:
- Backend API implementation (40+ endpoints)
- Frontend conversion execution
- Integration testing
- Production deployment

## 🚧 RISK MANAGEMENT

### High Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Backend endpoints not ready | Blocks frontend integration | Feature flags for mock/real API toggle; Priority-based delivery (P1, P2, P3); Parallel development |
| Brainium API not documented | Can't integrate external API | Get docs early; Test early; Backup proxy plan through encore_backend |
| Auth issues blocking work | Entire system blocked | Implement auth first; Test thoroughly; Have mock fallback |

### Medium Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Performance degradation | Poor user experience | Caching strategy; Monitoring; Loading skeletons; Bundle optimization |
| Scope creep | Timeline delays | Freeze scope; Document v2.0 requests; Stakeholder sign-off |
| TypeScript mismatches | Integration issues | Review API responses early; Update interfaces; Strict mode |

## ⏱️ TIMELINE OVERVIEW

**Total Estimated Duration**: 8-10 weeks

```
Week 0:  Planning & Questions ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100%
Week 1:  Foundation + Auth    ━━━━━━━━━░░░░░░░  50%
Week 2:  API Integration      ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   0%
Week 3:  Components           ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   0%
Week 4:  Production Ready     ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   0%

Week 7-8: Deployment          ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   0%
```

**Critical Path**:
1. Answer questions → Approve plan
2. Backend P1 endpoints + Frontend foundation (parallel)
3. Backend P2 + Frontend integration (parallel)
4. Backend P3 + Frontend production (parallel)
5. Integration testing
6. Production deployment

**Acceleration Opportunities**:
- Can complete in 4-5 weeks with aggressive parallel work
- Backend P1 ready by Week 1 enables rapid frontend progress
- Dedicated resources on backend and frontend simultaneously

## 📝 SUPERVISION NOTES

### Key Insights

1. **Mockup is Gold**: The completed mockup defines exactly what we're building. Use it as the source of truth for UI/UX.

2. **Backend is Critical Path**: Frontend can't fully integrate until backend APIs exist. Prioritize backend development.

3. **Brainium API Needs Attention**: Validated but has critical issues. Must be fixed before production.

4. **Questions Must Be Answered**: 50+ questions block decisions. Need stakeholder input.

5. **Parallel Work Possible**: Frontend and backend can develop simultaneously with API contracts defined upfront.

### Assumptions

1. **User has flexibility**: Can modify either mockup or encore_backend as needed
2. **AWS access available**: Backend already configured with AWS services
3. **MySQL access working**: SSH tunnel validated and functional
4. **No access to legacy Encore**: Integration through MySQL read-only is acceptable

### Constraints

1. **Legacy system access**: No direct access to main Encore system
2. **Brainium API external**: Depends on external team for fixes
3. **Resource availability**: Unknown (need to clarify available developers)
4. **Timeline flexibility**: Unknown (need stakeholder input)

---

## 🔄 SESSION MANAGEMENT

### After Each Session

**Supervisor Tasks**:
1. Update `CURRENT-STATUS.md` with progress
2. Add thinking entry to `THINKING-LOG.md`
3. Update `DELEGATION-TRACKER.md` if work delegated
4. Log decisions in `DECISIONS-LOG.md`
5. Update main `CHANGELOG.md` if significant progress

**Context Preservation**:
- Document what was accomplished
- Note what's pending
- Record any blockers discovered
- Document decisions made
- List next priorities

### Restoring Context

If starting a new conversation, read these in order:
1. `README.md` (this folder's purpose)
2. `SUPERVISOR-FRAMEWORK.md` (this file - capabilities and mission)
3. `CURRENT-STATUS.md` (where we are now)
4. `THINKING-LOG.md` (recent analysis and decisions)
5. `DELEGATION-TRACKER.md` (what's in progress)
