## üìù DECISIONS

### DEC-001 - Establish AI Supervisor Role and Documentation Structure

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Category**: Process / Organization
**Decision Maker**: User + AI Supervisor
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

**Context**:
User requested AI to take on Supervisor role for the Encore Loyalty AI Feedback System project. Need way to maintain context across sessions and coordinate work across multiple AI threads and developers.

**Decision**:
Create `/docs/SUPERVISOR/` directory with comprehensive documentation structure including:
- SUPERVISOR-FRAMEWORK.md (capabilities and mission)
- README.md (folder purpose and usage)
- CURRENT-STATUS.md (living project status)
- THINKING-LOG.md (analysis and reasoning)
- DELEGATION-TRACKER.md (work tracking)
- DECISIONS-LOG.md (this file)

**Rationale**:
- Context preservation across multiple chat sessions
- Clear reference point for supervision capabilities
- Structured thinking and decision documentation
- Enables restoration of supervisor role if context lost
- Provides accountability trail

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **No formal structure** - Rejected: Would lose context between sessions
2. **Single document** - Rejected: Too unstructured, hard to maintain
3. **Integrate with existing docs** - Rejected: Supervisor needs dedicated space

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Context can be restored in new sessions
- ‚úÖ Clear framework for supervision activities
- ‚úÖ Structured location for thinking documents
- ‚úÖ Better project visibility and tracking

**Related Documents**:
- `/docs/SUPERVISOR/README.md`
- `/docs/SUPERVISOR/SUPERVISOR-FRAMEWORK.md`

**Implementation**:
Created all supervisor documentation files with templates and initial content.

### DEC-002 - Priority-Based Backend API Development (P1/P2/P3)

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Category**: Technical / Architecture
**Decision Maker**: AI Supervisor (proposed, awaiting user approval)
**Status**: üü° Proposed

**Context**:
Need to implement 40+ API endpoints for frontend integration. Can't build everything at once. Frontend is blocked until backend APIs exist.

**Decision**:
Categorize all required endpoints into three priority levels:
- **P1 (Critical)**: ~15 endpoints - Auth, Settings, Basic Feedback - Week 1
- **P2 (Core)**: ~15 endpoints - Advanced Feedback, Analytics - Week 2
- **P3 (Advanced)**: ~10+ endpoints - Admin features, Reports - Week 3+

**Rationale**:
- Unblock frontend development faster
- Enable parallel work (frontend can use P1 APIs while P2 is built)
- Focus on critical path first
- Deliver value incrementally
- Can test and validate earlier

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Build all at once** - Rejected: Takes too long, blocks frontend
2. **Build as needed** - Rejected: Less structured, harder to plan
3. **Frontend-driven** - Rejected: Frontend team might not know backend complexity

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Frontend can start integration after Week 1 (P1 complete)
- ‚úÖ Parallel development possible
- ‚úÖ Faster time to first integration test
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires careful prioritization decisions

**Dependencies**:
- Need to review `/docs/plan-mockup-to-frontend/04-BACKEND-REQUIREMENTS.md`
- May need to adjust priorities based on frontend needs

**Related Documents**:
- `/docs/plan-mockup-to-frontend/04-BACKEND-REQUIREMENTS.md`

**Next Steps**:
- Get user approval
- Create detailed P1 endpoint specifications
- Assign developer or create AI delegation plan

### DEC-003 - Use Feature Flags for Mock vs Real API Toggle

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Category**: Technical / Architecture
**Decision Maker**: AI Supervisor (proposed, awaiting user approval)
**Status**: üü° Proposed

**Context**:
Frontend conversion can start before backend APIs are ready. Need a way to develop and test frontend without waiting for backend completion.

**Decision**:
Implement feature flags in frontend to toggle between mock API and real API:
```typescript
const USE_MOCK_API = process.env.REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_API === 'true';
const apiService = USE_MOCK_API ? mockApi : realApi;
```

**Rationale**:
- Enables parallel frontend/backend development
- Frontend can develop full features with mock data
- Easy to switch to real API for testing
- Can demo with mock if backend not ready
- Reduces coupling during development

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Wait for backend** - Rejected: Blocks frontend progress, slows project
2. **Separate branch** - Rejected: Merge conflicts, harder to maintain
3. **Conditional imports** - Considered: Similar outcome, more complex

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Frontend development unblocked
- ‚úÖ Can test frontend independently
- ‚úÖ Smooth transition to real API
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to ensure feature flag removed before production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Two code paths to maintain during development

**Implementation Details**:
- Use environment variable: `REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_API`
- Create abstraction layer for API calls
- Keep mock and real API interfaces identical
- Remove feature flag after full integration testing

**Related Documents**:
- `/docs/plan-mockup-to-frontend/01-DETAILED-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`

**Next Steps**:
- Get user approval
- Implement in Phase 1 of frontend conversion
- Document usage in developer guide

### DEC-004 - Prioritize Legacy Source Code Archive Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Category**: Strategic / Planning
**Decision Maker**: AI Supervisor (with user input)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Approved (by user request)

**Context**:
User received 637 MB source code archive from Brainium team containing legacy Encore Loyalty system (CakePHP application). This is the system we don't have direct access to. Archive contains complete admin panel, API, and customer review interface.

**Decision**:
**Immediately prioritize comprehensive analysis of the source code archive** before other planning activities. Make this Priority #1, shifting from "Answer questions ‚Üí Start backend" to "Analyze archive ‚Üí Answer questions ‚Üí Start backend".

Create delegation DEL-001 with detailed 8-objective analysis plan.

**Rationale**:
- **High Value**: Archive likely contains answers to 30+ of our 50 critical questions
- **Risk Reduction**: Eliminates guesswork about legacy system behavior
- **Speeds Development**: Backend team gets exact schema, API endpoints, workflows
- **Ensures Compatibility**: Can match existing patterns precisely
- **Better Architecture**: Informed decisions based on real code, not assumptions
- **Low Cost**: 4-6 hours of analysis vs weeks of trial-and-error integration

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Continue with question-answering first** - Rejected: Many answers are in the code
2. **Lightweight review only** - Rejected: Need comprehensive understanding
3. **Analyze after starting development** - Rejected: Would cause rework and delays
4. **Have user analyze directly** - Rejected: AI can do systematic analysis faster

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Answers 30+ questions directly from code
- ‚úÖ Provides exact database schema
- ‚úÖ Identifies all API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Reveals business logic and workflows
- ‚úÖ Reduces backend development risk dramatically
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Adds 1 day to planning (but saves weeks in development)

**Trade-offs**:
- We gain: Complete understanding of legacy system, reduced risk, faster development
- We lose: 1 day of immediate progress (but net time savings overall)

**Dependencies**:
- Worker thread availability (4-6 hours)
- Archive accessibility at `/home/ec2-user/encore-loyalty-new-system/encore_code_archive/`

**Related Documents**:
- Delegation prompt: `/docs/SUPERVISOR/WORKER-PROMPTS/PROMPT-001-ENCORE-ARCHIVE-ANALYSIS.md`
- Delegation tracker: `DELEGATION-TRACKER.md` (DEL-001)
- Archive location: `/home/ec2-user/encore-loyalty-new-system/encore_code_archive/`

**Implementation**:
1. Created comprehensive 400+ line analysis prompt
2. Defined 8 major analysis objectives
3. Specified deliverables and success criteria
4. Created delegation entry DEL-001
5. Updated priorities in CURRENT-STATUS.md
6. Updated THINKING-LOG.md with strategic analysis

**Next Steps**:
- User assigns worker thread (Cursor/Windsurf/Claude/other)
- Worker executes analysis using detailed prompt
- Supervisor reviews findings
- Update questions document with answers
- Proceed with backend planning using real data

**Review Date**: After analysis completion (within 24 hours)
