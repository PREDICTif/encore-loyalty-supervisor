## üöÄ Quick Start

### For New Users

1. **Read the Overview**: Start with `README.md` to understand the framework
2. **Check Current Status**: Read `CURRENT-STATUS.md` to see project state
3. **Quick Context**: Review `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` for rapid orientation
4. **Deep Dive**: Read `SUPERVISOR-FRAMEWORK.md` for complete capabilities

### For AI Restoration

If you need to restore the AI Supervisor role in a new conversation:

1. Share these files with the AI:
   - `SUPERVISOR-FRAMEWORK.md` (capabilities and mission)
   - `CURRENT-STATUS.md` (current project state)
   - `THINKING-LOG.md` (recent strategic analysis)

2. Ask the AI to confirm understanding of:
   - The project mission
   - The supervisor role
   - Current status and blockers
   - Next priorities

3. Resume work from the current state

## üéØ Why This Framework Exists

**The Problem**: AI agents lose context between sessions, leading to repeated work, inconsistent decisions, and lack of strategic awareness. Complex projects become chaotic without systematic oversight.

**The Solution**: This framework provides a structured approach for AI supervision that maintains context, documents decisions, tracks progress, and ensures quality across long-running, complex projects.

**The Result**: Systematic execution with accountability, continuity, and strategic awareness preserved across all sessions and transitions.
